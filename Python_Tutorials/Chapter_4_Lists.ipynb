        "* Lists are one of many ways of organizing data in Python\n",

        "* The `len()` function returns the number of elements in a list\n",
        "* Use an item's index to fetch it from its list, e.g. `my_list[0]`\n",
        "* The Python shortcut for the last item in a list is `my_list[-1]`\n",
        "* Python idexing starts at 0 instead of 1\n",
        "* Use slicing to fetch multiple items from a list:  `my_list[start:end]`\n",
        "* A list's values can be replaced by assigning new values to them:  `my_list[3] = 3.14'\n",
        "* Methods are functions that are tied to specific objects. Python lists have many methods available\n",
        "* Use the list method `.append()` to add items to the end of a list\n",
        "* use the `del` command to delete items from a list by index\n",
        "* use the `.remove()` method to delete items by value\n",
        "* Remove all elements from a list by setting it equal to the empty list:  `my_list = []'\n",

        "* Cope lists using the `.copy()` method\n",
        "* Characters in a string can be fetched using the same indexing as lists\n",
        "* Don't forget to use square brackets to create lists. If you use parentheses `()` you will be creating a tuple, which has very different properties."
